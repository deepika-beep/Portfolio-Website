          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="meet-style">Meet App</span> is a serverless, progressive
            web application (PWA) built with React using a test-driven
            development (TDD)technique. The application uses the Google Calendar
            API to fetch upcoming events. Users of this app will be able to use it whenever they want to view upcoming events for a specific city.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="meet-style">Meet App</span> was a personal project I
            built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to
            demonstrate my mastery to create progressive web app with the
            ability to work offline and a serverless backend developed using a
            TDD technique.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            The aim of the project is to have a responsive Serveless backend and
            a progressive web app that I can add to my professional
            portfolio. The problem I needed to solve is to build a PWA using
            React application and the app should be covered by tests with a
            coverage rate >= 90% from scratch.

      <h2 class="approach-title">Approach</h2>
      <div class="content"> 
        <p>I created the app using React and TDD technique. The app uses the Google
        Calendar API to fetch upcoming events for a selected city, and OAuth2
        authentication flow. I used serverless functions (AWS lambda) for the
        authorization server instead of using a traditional server. I make sure
        that the app works on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari,
        Edge, and Opera, as well as on IE11 and display well on all screen
        sizes. The app works offline or in slow network conditions with the help
        of a service worker. The recharts library is used to visualize data with
        a scatter graph and a pie chart.</p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        This is one of my favorite and challenging project. I have enjoyed
        building serverless,progressive web application and writing
        tests. Writing tests before writing the actual functionality for the app
        was a challenge for me. But through writing tests for each user stories,
        not just allow me to get deliver high-quality code but also made me
        familiar using Test Driven Development technique.

      <h2>Duration</h2>
      <p>
        The development of the Meet App took me as longer as normally due to the fact that I needed time to wrap my head around how Serverless App and testing works.
